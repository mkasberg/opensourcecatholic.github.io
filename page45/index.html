  <p>Hello, friends.</p>
<p>I'm writing my undergraduate thesis on the Church's need to utilize new media. Exciting, eh? You may be interested in:</p>
<p>- Case Studies: I'm seeking some parishes and ministries who are using, have used, or are planning to begin using new media.</p>
<p>- Literature Search: Got some great bookmarked links on the Church + new media? Sharing is caring.</p>
<p>- Literature Collection: I'd love to know if there are any "libraries," directories or collections of links to articles about the Church and new media. If a place like...</p>

<div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
  <p>I just found a great little PHP utility called <a href="http://milianw.de/projects/markdownify/">Markdownify</a>.  It provides a good PHP solution for those times when you want to convert HTML into plain text.  For example, I often have clients who create newsletters through a WYSIWYG interface, and Markdownify can create the plain text version very easily.  My current use for it is converting the HTML description of an event from an online calendar into plain text for use in an iCal feed.</p>
<p>In case you've never heard of Markdown... it's a plain text formatting syntax, which...</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.americanpapist.com/blog.html">American Papist</a> has posted this vocations video today.  Quite well done, I have seen some of the video technique before from Grassroots Films, specifically that cool effect of blurring part of the picture.    Any ideas what software they are using for software?  Also, is <a href="http://www.grassrootsfilms.com">Grassroots Films</a> a Catholic company?  I see they are based out of New York, so I guess that makes sense they worked on this project.   </p>

  <p>Hit the Apple store at Ridgedale around 11am this morning. Place was packed. Line for Snow Leopard was about 5 deep but moving pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Grabbed Subway, then to the home office to do some loading.</p>
<p>I thought I read somewhere that's it's a 15-20 minute upgrade...uh uh. Took almost an hour. While I was waiting, I putzed around on my XP machine while watching the Macbook out of the corner of my eye.</p>
<p>After a few reboots...upgrade complete.</p>

  <p>I came across an interesting problem in the blogosphere yesterday.  Patrick Madrid wrote <a href="http://patrickmadrid.blogspot.com/2009/08/my-response-to-sr-maureen-fiedlers.html">this blog</a> about a gushy article on Sen. Ted Kennedy's passing.  A blog commenter(who apparently often posts on his site not in a malicious way) uses the username "Patrick" and claimed that he doubted that Sen. Kennedy repented of his pro-choice politics before death.  Other users and some of the Media 1.0 crowd apparently attributed the comments to Patrick Madrid who's username is "Patrick Madrid" and rebuked him for it.  Patrick Madrid clarified it was not him, but I can...</p>

  <p>Hello everyone!  I finally joined (at Jeff's persistent urging).  I'm excited to meet other Catholics who share the burden of building websites.  I've been a web developer since 2002, and besides a short job I took after college, I've been working for Catholic companies doing web development ever since, and I've always been the only "web guy" around.  This site is a good idea to connect all of us.</p>
<p>However, I'm a little confused — there seems to be too many ways to share and discuss on this site than...</p>
