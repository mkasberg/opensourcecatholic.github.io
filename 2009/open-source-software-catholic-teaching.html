    <p>From the wayback machine: an article that originally appeared in 2005 on Linux.com, written by Marco Fioretti, titled &quot;Free software's surprising sympathy with Catholic doctrine.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The technological configuration underlying the Internet has a considerable bearing on its ethical aspects. Use of the new information technology and the Internet needs to be informed and guided by a resolute commitment to the practice of solidarity in the service of the common good. The Internet requires international cooperation in setting standards and establishing mechanisms to promote and protect [that common good]. Individuals, groups, and nations must have access to these new technologies. Cyberspace ought to be a resource of comprehensive information and services available without charge to all, and in a wide range of languages. The winner in this process will be humanity as a whole and not just a wealthy elite that controls science, technology, and the planet's resources. Determined action in the private and public sectors is needed to close and eventually eliminate the digital divide.&quot;</p>
<p>The above statements sound as if they could have been written by Richard M. Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation (FSF). In fact, they come from the Vatican Report &quot;Ethics in Internet&quot; (EiI). The FSF position on the same issues is that society &quot;needs information that is truly available to its citizens -- for example, programs that people can read, fix, adapt, and improve, not just operate.&quot;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In his article, Mr. Fioretti makes many points about the relationship of sound Catholic doctrine and open source software development. He includes arguments supported by many official Church documents, including <a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_26031967_populorum_en.html">Populorum Progressio</a>, <a href="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/pccs/documents/rc_pc_pccs_doc_23051971_communio_en.html">Communio et Progressio</a>, <a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_14091981_laborem-exercens_en.html">Laborem exercens</a>, and <a href="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/pccs/documents/rc_pc_pccs_doc_20020228_church-internet_en.html">The Church and the Internet</a>.</p>
<p>A few interesting points made in the article:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Catholic Church <strong>should not use proprietary file formats</strong> and computer protocols, since they can become a way to prevent access to information, restrict it or lock end users to any specific (maybe too expensive) software program.</li>
    <li>The Catholic Church should work to allow open and free access to any and all information the faithful have a right to know, and doing so could involve (among other things):
    <ul>
        <li>Adopting the Free international standard OpenDocument for office documents in all Catholic institutions worldwide.</li>
        <li>Avoiding proprietary file formats and protocols on Catholic Web sites and in official Church documents, and not accepting them in any official communication.</li>
        <li>Making sure that all Catholic Web sites are certified as <strong>viewable with any browser</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>What do you think? I've seem my fair share of Word documents, Publisher documents, and Microsoft lock-in in pretty much every corner of the Church I'm involved with... And it's also sad when I find software/websites break in non-Microsoft non-Internet Explorer environments.</p>
