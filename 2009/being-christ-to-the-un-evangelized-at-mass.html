    <p>I have a tough time with this. &nbsp;Today, at my home parish usual 9:00 Mass we had a baptism.&nbsp; My family was sitting in our usual spot near the front.&nbsp; Directly in front of us was the family of the infant being baptized.&nbsp; As usual several members of the family showed signs that probably aren't regular Mass attendees.</p>
<p>In today's case, 4 younger adults (20 somethings) were right in front of us.&nbsp; One young man was wearing a very tall spiked mohawk, and those 1/2 inch ear piercing holes.&nbsp; 2 young ladies with some sort of eastern / asian style tatoos, and anothrer young man that looked like what we in PDX call a &quot;hipster.&quot;&nbsp; These 4 were whispering much of the time, snickering on occasion, 3 of them were chewing gum.&nbsp; They didn't show any sign of interest or participation in what was happening.&nbsp; They seemed to be trying to be respectful in the sense that they at least knew not to be loud - If I'd been a few pews back or on the other side, I wouldn't have notieced. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I particularly noticed that they actually payed not attention during the baptism (which was presumably the only reason they were there), and that they seemed almost to make a point of not responding to the renewal of baptismal vows (I was close enough to hear). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, my dilemna really doesn't have much to do with any of &quot;what they did.&quot;&nbsp; I want to be judgemental, and feel a little superior.&nbsp; I'd like to be self-rightous.&nbsp; I thought of approaching them and asking them a pointed question, or lecturing them.&nbsp; Only by God's grace was I able to ask for Charity and to pray for them.&nbsp; Then I was able to see that maybe, just maybe being here today will be a small spark that brings them back to the Church (at least 3 of them probably were Catholic - the went to communion anyway).&nbsp; Anything I said to them was unlikely to help, and might be one more thing that pushed them (or they used as an excuse) away from the Church.</p>
<p>So how do we evangelize people who are Catholic and who are at Mass, but who don't seem to know about the Gospel or the Eucharist?&nbsp; </p>
