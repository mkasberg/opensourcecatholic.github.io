  <p>After reading an article (from Six Revisions) on the <a href="http://sixrevisions.com/resources/the-history-of-the-internet-in-a-nutshell/">History of the Internet</a>, I realized just how cutting-edge our Church has been, historically, when it comes to using the web for communications. The Vatican website (<a href="http://www.vatican.va/">www.vatican.va</a>) was one of the first globally-relevant and vast websites in the world!</p>
<p>The site was built in 1995 as a repository of Church documents, and has since been greatly expanded. However, in this time, pages are getting lost, information is, at best, hard to find, and the generic design has barely...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>VATICAN CITY (CNS) -- Communications technology keeps changing, but the need to deliver a message with truth and charity is never obsolete, said Italian Archbishop Claudio Maria Celli.<br>
<br>
As president of the Pontifical Council for Social Communications, Archbishop Celli presided over a four-day meeting of cardinals, bishops and Catholic media professionals to discuss -- mainly in small groups -- new pastoral guidelines for church communications.<br>
<br>A recurring theme during the meeting Oct. 26-29 was what constitutes Catholic</p>

  <p>I spent a bit of time today evaluating text editing on my mac. Honestly, I've just been using text edit (I really only used notepad on Windows), since I don't do much heavy code lifting.</p>
<p>Finally got around to Text Wrangler and have made that my default editor. The line numbers and color coding makes a few things easier.</p>
<p>But...I'm also considering Textmate and Coda (BTW...I do have Dreamweaver CS4, but I don't really like the load time and performance hit with that for simple code editing).</p>

  <p>As some of you already know, I was a PC for about 15 years (although I was a Mac before that when I worked in the music biz).</p>
<p>When I made the leap to my MacBook Pro about 5 months ago, I figured I'd need to do some virtualization, so I picked up Parallels 4. Just got an email today about the new version 5 ($39), so I read what I could find about it (not much BTW) and went for it.</p>
<p>Very pleased so far! I've got a 2.5Ghz...</p>
