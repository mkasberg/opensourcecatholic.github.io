  <p>I have a tough time with this.  Today, at my home parish usual 9:00 Mass we had a baptism.  My family was sitting in our usual spot near the front.  Directly in front of us was the family of the infant being baptized.  As usual several members of the family showed signs that probably aren't regular Mass attendees.</p>
<p>In today's case, 4 younger adults (20 somethings) were right in front of us.  One young man was wearing a very tall spiked mohawk, and those 1/2 inch ear piercing holes.  2...</p>

  <p>If you're like me, you run multiple browsers; <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com/">FireFox</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a>, <a href="http://caminobrowser.org/">Camino</a>, and (last, and certainly least) Internet Explorer... actually, all three of the past versions of IE: 6, 7 and 8. And, if you have any ability to see, you'll notice that there are aspects of the site that look different—most notably the navigation buttons, the sidebar sections, and certain other elements.</p>
<p>The reason for this has to do with a principle embraced by those interested in making the web a better place: <strike>progressive enhancement</strike> <strong>graceful degredation</strong>...</p>

</h2>

<div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
  <p>It'd be pretty awesome if we could create a great, clean logo to be used for Open Source Catholic. Right now the Twitter account and such all use a simple wordmark (OSC), but a good logo that prints, displays, and looks great would be quite beneficial, I think.</p>
<p>Any ideas for what it should look like? How it should be styled? Please let us know!</p>

	We all know the story about <a href="http://twitter.com/CurtJester/status/1143171133">@CurtJester's famous tweet</a> (read more on <a href="http://www.lolsaints.com/about">LOLSaints' About page</a>). But how was the website set up? What kind of work went into it's creation, and how can you do the same if you need a similar kind of community-oriented blog?</p>
<p>After seeing the Curt Jester's tweet, I immediately began thinking about what I wanted to have happen on LOLSaints; I had to decide what specific kind of content to use, how often the site would be updated, and how much involvement registered users...</p>

<div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
  <p>One idea that we've been thinking of implementing is the ability for any of our users to set up his own podcast. It's not that hard to enable (basically, they can post 'episodes' of their podcasts as normal blog posts—just attach an MP3, and it will be put into the individual user's blog feed.</p>
<p>However, I have two concerns about this: 1. My hosting costs - it would be ideal if I had a plain old media server where the file uploads went to; right now, I only have one...</p>

<div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
  <p>On June 10, 2009, the <a href="http://www.archstl.org/">Archdiocese of Saint Louis</a> was blessed to have its tenth bishop (and ninth Archbishop; Robert J. Carlson) Installed at a ceremony in the <a href="http://www.cathedralstl.org/">Cathedral-Basilica of Saint Louis</a>. The event was not only recorded for future reference; it was streamed to the Archdiocesan website, put on satellite for <a href="http://www.ewtn.com">EWTN</a> and <a href="http://www.catholictv.com">CatholicTV</a> to pick up and air live, and sent to local TV stations as well.</p>
