According to a new global study by the University of Maryland's International Center for Media &amp; the Public Affairs (ICMPA) and the Salzburg Academy on Media &amp; Global Change, they're all addicted to media. That might not seem like news—after all, there's a reason the term "CrackBerry" came into being—but just how severely students are addicted is startling, and has real implications for our schools</p></blockquote>...

  <p>About a week after completing work on the first release of the Archdiocese of St. Louis' "Catholic STL" app, I decided to spend a few nights and weekends working on a more personal project...</p>
<p>A few months ago, I was browsing the App Store, looking for a simple Catholic news app where I could quickly browse through the latest Catholic news from a relatively comprehensive array of sources.

<p>I think the IE development and marketing team at Microsoft 'gets' the situation, and is being very creative about it's efforts in promoting IE9 (case in point: <a href="http://ie6countdown.com/">IE6 Countdown</a>). As to how far IE9 will ultimately go towards stemming web developers' collective hatred toward Explorer as a platform... that remains to be seen.</p>

  <p>Hi, y'all. I'm the communications director/newspaper editor for a diocese in the Great Lakes area. Currently we have a proprietary solution that strikes me (and I don't want to go into detail) as both expensive and limited. (Not a good combination!) I have some other issues with it too.</p>

  <p>One question I’m often asked by many other diocesan web development teams/individuals is how we put together our online Mass Time search (also used for searching adoration and reconciliation times).
