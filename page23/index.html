  <p>I'm working on a new Intranet for the Archdiocese of St. Louis, and I've been developing in Drupal for the time being (the end-user experience, in my opinion, is crucial to the success or downfall of this Intranet), but the Data Center has offered SharePoint as an option.</p>
<p>Some of the main features are profile pages (with pictures of users), a 'dashboard' page on which people will be able to see, at a glance, information they need to see for the day, and Archdiocesan news.</p>

  <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I wanted to introduce my company - Green Egg Media.</p>
<p>Green Egg Media was started in 2008 by myself and a fellow Notre Dame grad, Lance Johnson.

<div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
  <p>From Matthew Warner's blog on the National Catholic Register website: <a href="http://www.ncregister.com/blog/how-are-parishes-using-new-media/">How are parishes using new media?</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last week I asked my Twitter followers for some examples of parishes using new media. I got some good ones, which I was pleased with. So thank you fellow tweeters!</p>
<p>But I must admit that, <strong>overall, I was a bit disappointed in my search</strong>. I also “googled” the topic fairly extensively and the pickin’s were few. I hope that one day when we google “Catholic Parish,” we are blown away with how impressed</p>

  <p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>I'm new here, but I was checking out the Forum postings and saw that there was a lot of love for Drupal/Joomla but I was wondering if anyone used ExpressionEngine, either 1.x or 2.x.</p>
<p>I run a design/development company with my business partner - both Catholic dudes. We do some work for Catholic organizations, and love the people and the work.</p>
<p>We were floating around ModX, Wordpress, and even Concrete5, and then we started using EE and never looked back. The best part for me (as the guy...</p>

<div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
  <p>Often, a school has radically different requirements than a parish, even though the two are, physically, attached to each other. Schools have teachers, classrooms, assignments, etc., and serve a very different audience than a general parish.</p>
<p>Because of this, some schools have entirely different websites than their parent parishes, or, sometimes, the school has a unique section on the main parish website.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, here is a great site to get you started in your development of a website, social media solutions, etc.:</p>

It includes stories with mysterious titles like Drupal Gardens enters Open Public Beta and understandable ones like Live-Blogging to Drive Traffic, Interest to Organizational Events. Some of you may find it useful.</p>

<div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
  <p>An idea I've been having in the back of my mind for some time is putting the Rosary (or another devotional) online in such a way as to (a) faithfully instruct individuals on the purpose and beauty in its prayer, and (b) stretch my skills and build a usable, friendly, and prayerful web application.</p>
<p>I envision building a standards-compliant/HTML5 site which leads a Catholic through the recitation of the Holy Rosary, or maybe the Chaplet of Divine Mercy, and works across as many modern browsers as is possible, without Flash,...</p>
