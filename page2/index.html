  <p>While browsing Hacker News today, I noticed a neat project by Tim Morgan, <a href="https://github.com/churchio/onebody">OneBody</a>. It is described as a “private member portal for churches” that offers “church directory and social networking” for your Church.</p>

  <p>Hi,</p>

<p>it’s a pity that this forum attracts so little attention, because opportunities for leveraging web technologies in the church are plenty…</p>

<p>Here’s an announcement of a new app -under development- that may be useful for churches. It’s called MapTiming and the idea is to create a web app where you store information about upcoming events or schedules. You store location information as well as calendar date and time. The events are displayed on a map, and can be filtered based on a selected timeframe. MapTiming shows in a glance...</p>

  <p>Hi,</p>

<p>I have the impression the activity on the forum is quite low, nevertheless I’m going to put forward a question. As you can see in my previous post, I’m working on some ideas to get the church some presence on mobile media.</p>

<p>My main use case is for a faithful or anyone who’s interested, to find out what’s going on in his neighbourhood. There should be a (web) app that can answer concrete questions like</p>

<ul>
  <li>where can I attent mass later today closeby? (may include e.g. funeral masses)</li>
  <li>which</li>

<div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
  <p>Hi,</p>

<p>If you ever need to do something with maps, make sure to look at Google Fusion Tables. I’ve used them to create a web app where you can look up on the map where in the neighborhood you can go to mass. You can filter to look for masses that start immediately, that start later today or that take place tomorrow. On clicking a church, you get a view of all scheduled masses.</p>

<p>Here are some links:</p>

  <p>Earlier this year, a study found that <a href="http://www.techhive.com/article/254694/religious_sites_carry_more_malware_than_porn_sites_security_firm_reports.html">religious websites have more malware than porn websites</a>. Unfortunately, this is not too surprising.</p>

<p>Pornography sites are often run by very profitable media conglomerates, and it’s in their best interests to have reliable, fast websites. Religious websites (like your parish website, or a site for a small nonprofit) are often run on a shoestring budget and maintained by volunteers, if at all.</p>

<p>In the past, when websites were mostly static pages, and sites were hosted mostly on shared hosting, where the hosting...</p>
