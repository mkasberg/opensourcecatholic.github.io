  <p>I hear from many people involved in Diocesan and organizational work that they are interested in "doing more things online" and "connecting with their members online." it's great to wish for these things, and even better to try to achieve them. But wouldn't it be nice to <em>actually</em> achieve these goals?</p>
<p>It's not the hardest thing to do. And it's not like technology is standing in the way and is extrememly hard to use... But time and time again, I see things done that hinder the Church's ability to truly communicate and connect with it's members...</p>

<p>Vatican City, Oct 29, 2009 / 11:30 am (CNA) — Addressing the full Pontifical Council for Social Communications today, Benedict XVI urged its members to help communicate the teachings of the Church on the “<strong>digital continent</strong>” of the ever-changing technological landscape.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the role of social networking and increasingly real-time electronic communication, Pope Benedict XVI said on Thursday that "modern culture is established, even before its content, in the very fact of the existence of new forms of communication that use new</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don't know of any parish website I would say is "great." A couple "good" or "okay" ones, maybe, but nothing to call home and tell my Mom about. So, what are my criteria for a great parish website? One of which I would be proud to call myself a member?</p>

  <p>For the past week (and the next), <a href="http://www.lifeisaprayer.com/special-sections/roma">I've been in the Eternal City</a>, helping the Redemptorist community stream their 24th General Chapter. They wanted to share the proceedings in a more immediate fashion with the broader Redemptorist community around the world, and this is probably the best way to do it.</p>
<p>A few months ago, I was approached by the Redemptorists' communications director and asked what kind of equipment he would need to take a live video feed from a multi-camera setup, and broadcast it on Ustream (free streaming...</p>

  <p>After reading Seth Godin's simple article on reducing complexity, entitled <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/10/fear-of-apples.html">Fear of Apples</a>, I felt compelled to write  short piece about steps one could take to make users' browsing experience that much nicer.</p>
<p>Basically, by reducing complexity and limiting people's options, you free them to (a) choose easier, and (b) remember what they've chosen.</p>
<p>As a quick example, we start with the Archdiocese of Saint Louis' current website, which gives users a metric ton of choices for navigation:</p>
