	I was just invited to the <a href="http://www.drupalgardens.com/">Drupal Gardens</a> private beta today, and I have to say, it's a leap forward in terms of building out quick, beautiful, and well-designed websites. But it takes things many, many, many steps further than a simple Wordpress or Blogger site.</p>
<p>Drupal Gardens is built with Drupal at its core, and every site instance you set up is basically an entire Drupal website (and it's completely exportable, so if your needs grow beyond the Drupal Gardens garden, you can re-plant on another server). This means...</p>

	Hi, I'm helping create a new website for our youth group which is dedicated to developing open source software amongst many other projects. We are shifting to a Wordpress site (which we have pretty much completed) but want to base ourselves on LDAP so we can run concurrent CMSs. I'm wondering if anyone can help us with the LDAP side of things? If interested to help please email rjzaar at yahoo dot com.</p>

<div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
  <p>
	In early 2009, it was determined that the Archdiocese of Saint Louis needed to upgrade its website, mostly for security concerns. After investigating a move from Joomla 1.0.x to Joomla 1.5.x, the Archdiocese determined it would be more cost effective and a more future proof decision to migrate the over 49 individual Joomla sites that comprised www.archstl.org into a single Drupal installation.</p>

	While building the Archdiocese of Saint Louis' website (launching Feb. 22, 2010), I needed an easy and quick way to <strong>allow users to caption images, without much hassle</strong>. On the old Joomla version of the website, users would have to upload an image, then insert it, then click on it, then click another button to add an image caption, set border properties, add padding, etc.</p>
<p>
	To cut through most of that mess, I set up an <a href="http://drupal.org/project/imagefield">ImageField</a> with Drupal's <a href="http://drupal.org/project/insert">Insert</a> module, which helps save a few clicks (and eliminates...</p>
