  <p>I have, for some time, used the amazingly dexterous Rules module on my Drupal sites to receive email notifications when new comments were posted. I set up a Rule in the admin interface which would send an email if a new comment was saved on the site.</p>
<p>In the 'Message' section of the Rule's 'send email to arbitrary address' action, I would include a link to the commented-upon node, as well as the body of the comment text.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A few years ago, it would have been considered “cutting edge” for a parish to be using social media, but now everyone is doing it. So the question isn’t should parishes be using social media, but how can they use it with intentionality to support their ministry goals. Before a minister or parish committee member even sets up a Twitter account, Facebook page, or blog for the parish, they need to discern what it is they are trying to</p>

  <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>I just moved a website to a completely new hosting provider AND CMS (Joomla to WordPress).</p>
<p>The problem is that I'm getting a number of http requests that are obviously for the OLD site - variations like this - http://www.website.com/?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3483&amp;Itemid=384</p>
<p>Is there any way to 'redirect' these http requests to my new homepage (index.php). It would have to be a wildcard since there were over 3,000 articles on the old site.</p>
<p>To recap...is it possible to redirect http requests as follows</p>

  <p>Almost every website on the Internet is accessed using a name like "www.opensourcecatholic.com" or "www.archstl.org." These are called <em>domain names</em>.

  <p>I'm looking at installing APC (Alternative PHP Cache) on one of the VPS'es I support.</p>
<p>After doing some research, it sounds like it doesn't play nice with mod_suPHP, which I have installed as well.</p>
<p>Anyone have any experience with those 2?</p>
<p>The VPS - currently - only has 2 websites on it, one is a WordPress site, the other is Joomla.</p>
<p>Also, anyone using a CDN to offload content? Is it pricey</p>
<p>Thanks for any advice! </p>
