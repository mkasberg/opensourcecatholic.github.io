<div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
  <p>Hello all,</p>

<p>I recently finished a tutorial on how to setup Ubuntu 13.04 as a web server for local sites hosted within the users account.</p>

<p>I have switched to Ubuntu 13.04 running on my Dell XPS13 and it is amazing. Clean fast “open” :-)</p>

<p>Setting up Apache to serve my local sites was not very straight forward, so I decided to make a tutorial that should get anyone up and running in about 10 to 15 minutes.</p>

</h2>

<div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
  <p>I recently launched <a href="http://parish.io">a little site for finding Catholic parishes and mass times</a> called <em>parish.io</em>. It takes a very different approach to gathering parish info and mass times than other sites in this category. Not only is this approach beneficial to users (more accurate and complete mass schedules), I think it’s of particular interest to other software developers.</p>

<p>Rather than relying on manual data entry, <em>parish.io</em> gathers all of its info by scraping diocese and parish sites. It took months of hacking to validate the concept and develop the...</p>

<h3>What is Saintstir?</h3>

<p>Saintstir is the world’s first online Catholic saint taxonomy. We’re creating what can be best described as a genome that categorizes and classifies the saints by various attributes and dimensions, such as their graces/virtues, life experiences, and special powers, to name a few.</p>

<p>The taxonomy itself is extremely flexible and can change with user feedback. We currently have 200 saints and blesseds, but the goal is eventually all saints of the Church.</p>

</h2>

<div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
  <p>Back in 2006, I started to work on my first Catholic blog (www.beingfrank.co.nz).  As I started to explore Wordpress as a CMS and how the themes work within that platform, I wanted to get the colours of the site to change with the liturgical seasons of the Church - i.e. violet for Lent and Advent, gold for Easter etc.</p>

<p>So, I searched the web trying to find the algorithm that is used to calculate when Easter is, as all the other dates in the calendar basically stem from that. It...</p>

  <p>I wanted to thank the Pope as he retired but I didn’t know how. I happen to work with youth ministry, so I also wanted a way for teens to get involved. Then this idea came to me, why don’t we create a Twitter storm of thank-you messages. If we got enough, our tag would appear on “Trending” for all users on twitter even non-Catholics.</p>

<p>I mentioned it to a few who have more followers than I on twitter and got a positive response. So now I would like to...</p>
