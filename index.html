<p>Reading up on some of the past posts in this community, I see there have been a number of posts about open access to information, in particular (in this context) as regards the Catholic faith. Access to the biblical texts, access to the Catechism and magisterial documents… When a project is open source, it has a good possibility of surviving over time if it is able to create a community, because it remains accessible to the community even when the original people behind the project might not be...</p>

  <p>There are a number of projects out there that publish Bible texts online. You can look up Bible verses, and even compare between versions.</p>

<p>That’s great for just consulting a Bible verse. But what if you want to quote a Bible verse in a document, or on a website?</p>

<p>Most people would go to one of the websites where you can find an online version of the Bible, copy the verses they are interested in, and paste them into their document (or webpage). But then you probably have to reformat...</p>

<p>After almost eight years with Open Source Catholic as a Drupal 7 website hosted on infrastructure generously provided by <a href="http://www.midwesternmac.com/">Midwestern Mac</a>, I migrated <em>all</em> the Drupal site content into a static Jekyll-powered site hosted on GitHub Pages (thanks to a suggestion from <a href="https://github.com/iloveitaly">Michael Bianco</a>).</p>

<p>To maintain consistency we migrated <em>everything</em>, including comments and forum topics (we’re now using Disqus for commenting), and made sure all the old link paths were redirected to the new Jekyll structure.</p>

<p>Please let us know if you find any problems on this...</p>

<blockquote>"The main question at the start of our project was which format to save the texts. We needed to make sure [people] could still read the digital files in 50 years' time."

Ammenti explained that, in order for the manuscripts to be readable, the Vatican Library opted for open source tools that do not require proprietary platforms, such as Microsoft Office, to be read.</blockquote>

<p>Ammenti goes on to explain that the Vatican has chosen to use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FITS">FITS</a> image format in order to preserve digitized scans...</p>

<p>In this article, we will go over 5 things every parish website should have this year in 2015. We’ve prepared this as a checklist that includes a combination of website tools, content suggestions, and general functions. Before we begin, it’s important for you to treat this guide as a way to enhance a well-founded Catholic church website....</p>
